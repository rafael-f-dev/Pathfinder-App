# Pathfinder 
---
This is a full-stack React Native app. It allows users to select and validate a location using the Geoapify API, choose travel dates, and specify a focus for their trip. Trips are generated through the OpenAI API and saved locally using AsyncStorage. Users can easily view and manage their saved trips, with the option to read or delete past entries at any time.
